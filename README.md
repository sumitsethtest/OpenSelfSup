# OpenSelfSup 

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.1** or higher.

`OpenSelfSup` is an open source unsupervised representation learning toolbox based on PyTorch.

### What does this repo do?

Below is the relations among Unsupervised Learning, Self-Supervised Learning and Representation Learning. This repo focuses on the shadow area, i.e., Unsupervised Representation Learning. Self-Supervised Representation Learning is the major branch of it. Since in many cases we do not distingush between Self-Supervised Representation Learning and Unsupervised Representation Learning strictly, we still name this repo as `OpenSelfSup`.

- **Flexibility & Extensibility**

`OpenSelfSup` follows a similar code architecture of MMDetection while is even more flexible than MMDetection, since OpenSelfSup integrates various self-supervised tasks including classification, joint clustering and feature learning, contrastive learning, tasks with a memory bank, etc.

For existing methods in this repo, you only need to modify config files to adjust hyper-parameters. It is also simple to design your own methods, please refer to [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

- **Efficiency**

  All methods support multi-machine multi-gpu distributed training.

- **Standardized Benchmarks**

  We standardize the benchmarks including logistic regression, SVM / Low-shot SVM from linearly probed features, semi-supervised classification, and object detection. Below are the setting of these benchmarks.
